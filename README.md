Emergency Room Wait Time Analysis using SQL & Power BI

🔷 Project Overview
This project analyzes emergency department (ER) wait times across hospitals to identify delays, performance gaps, and operational patterns using SQL and Power BI. The goal is to extract actionable insights that can help improve patient flow and healthcare efficiency.

Data- source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xavierberge/hospital-emergency-dataset/data

🎯 Objectives:
Measure average and extreme ER wait times
Identify hospitals and regions with the longest delays
Analyze trends over time
Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for stakeholders

🛠 Tools & Technologies:
SQL – data cleaning, KPI calculations, aggregations
Power BI – interactive dashboards & visual storytelling
Healthcare Open Data – emergency department datasets

📊 Key KPIs:
Average ER wait time (minutes)
% of hospitals exceeding recommended wait thresholds
Best vs worst performing hospitals
Regional wait-time comparison
Time-based trends (monthly / yearly)

🔍 Key Insights (from analysis so far)
Significant variation in ER wait times across hospitals
Certain regions consistently experience higher delays
Peak wait times align with high patient-volume periods
Performance gaps suggest staffing and operational inefficiencies
